GO-RELOADED

This is a file that swaps commas and quotes to right order. Plus, it executes a command passed in parentheses such as cap , which denotes a capital letter in the word before. If there is also a number in the parenthesis, it changes to the command given in the parenthesis, as many words as are given in the parenthesis.
In this project, I used the standard Go library. To all this, functions were written independently.
